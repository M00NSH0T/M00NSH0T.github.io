title: YouTube series
excerpt: This first season focuses on the problem of predicting the track of hurricanes using machine learning. I plan to bring additional technologies into future seasons, such as 3d printing and robotics. Check it out.

Far too many tutorials on using Machine Learning out there make it seem like your whole job is just taking a nice pre-processed dataset that you were simply given and running it through the latest algorithm of the week. The reality of a true machine learning "engineer" however, is much dirtier, so to speak. Before a line of code ever gets written, there's a whole lot of work that has to get done, and a methodology we follow. Graduates of any of the top engineering schools all get this jammed down our throats through our whole college careers.

It's called the "core engineering design process," and it applies to all disciplines of engineering, from mechanical and chemical to electrical and computer. Following this is how we figure out what precise problem needs to be solved, define our design requirements, research existing solutions to figure out what's been done and how we might be able to improve it or apply it in a different way, and then design a solution that will actually solve the problem. Randomly grabbing a dataset and trying a million things with it might get you a usable solution as well (and on the surface sounds like it fits the old "fail fast and fail often" philosophy of Silicon Valley startups), but following the engineering design process will ensure that you maintain a bigger picture strategy that will likely bring you to a more creative and interesting solution that works far better in the end. And ultimately, this is what many of those tech startups are actually doing, at least the successful ones. There's a lot of work that has to get done to set up the design/build phase, but once that whappens, we build prototype after prototype... iterating and honing in on the a final design until our performance metrics reach the desired levels. This process more than anything else is the reason why our technology has seen such a drastic increase in the rate of improvement over the past hundred years.

So that's what this series is all about... applying the engineering design process to solve big problems with the coolest new tools. And we're starting off with hurricanes. If you're interested in getting your hands dirty with me as we apply this process to the problem of forecasting hurricanes using machine learning, strap in and subscribe. 

The series will follow the steps of the engineering design process. The result will likely be that some episodes will be longer than others, but I think this approach as a whole will convey the intent of the series better. Below are quick links to each video in the series, but to get notified of new episodes, you'll need to subscribe via YouTube.
