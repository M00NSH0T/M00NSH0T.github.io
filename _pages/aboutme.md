<hr />

I’m a graduate of the same engineering program as Bill Nye the Science Guy; the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University. This was a fantastic program, and I highly recommend checking it out if you’re looking for either an undergraduate or graduate engineering program. The Sibley School, and Cornell’s Engineering College as a whole, really try to give you a holistic education. Everyone learns a little bit about everything… we took numerous programming courses, science classes covering all subjects from chemistry to circuit design, and we were required to take at least two semesters of writing courses, another semester of technical writing, and six semesters of liberal arts… I chose to focus on philosophy and cognitive science. This sort of broad curriculum lines up extremely well with the latest findings in neuroscience, which suggest that the best way to excel in particular field isn’t to just dive super deep, but to learn about other, potentially unrelated subjects as well, so you can apply principles from elsewhere to problems in your own field and come up with more creative solutions in general.

Anyway, my undergraduate degree originally led me to get a job with a company called “Electric Boat,” which is subsidiary of General Dynamics. I hadn’t even heard of them when I dropped my resume off with them at Cornell’s career fair, but it turns out, they make the majority of our nuclear submarines. The job sounded awesome, and I was very excited to start. However, it was pretty short lived, as I quickly discovered that being an engineer there didn’t actually mean I would get to design anything. All the design work, it turned out, was done by union draftsmen, and the role of engineers was only to check their work. It quickly became tedious, and led me to head back to Cornell for a graduate degree.

Upon returning to Cornell, I quickly learned about a brand new program called the “Systems Engineering” minor, which was offered to all graduate students in all engineering fields. Now, it’s important to note here that this is not to be confused with the more prevailent “(network) systems engineer” IT position, which hadn’t yet risen to dominate the job boards when this was created. The original “Systems Engineering” role was actually quite old… dating back to Bell Labs in the 1940s, and gaining popularity during the the space race in the 1960s. You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering. 

Essentially, this program would teach me how to manage the design and construction of extremely complex systems, which is exactly what I had originally been hoping I would be doing at Electric Boat. I was hooked, and spent the next year working what were in retrospect pretty insane hours (probably 80-90 hour weeks) pulling more all nighters than in any other time in my life before or since. But it was totally worth it. I learned project management from a sociologist. Systems modeling from the engineer that helped lead Harley Davidson’s recovery from the brink of financial disaster. I took a class on how to use optimization algorithms to build design more efficient mechanical systems, and another class on how to design feedback control systems for virtually any type of device. 

My favorite class, however, was a one credit pass/fail colloquium series where some of Cornell’s most successful entrepreneurs would come back and tell their story. Each week featured another self made multimillionaire, from somebody who invented an artificial heart and a novel way to close bed sores, to another alumni who helped pioneer the video streaming technologies that have led to services like Netflix and Hulu. It was utterly fascinating hearing their stories, and a common theme quickly emerged. Nearly all of these successes were the result of repeated failures. None of the speakers succeeded with their first startup. It wasn’t until their second or even third that they actually made money. The main lesson I learned from them was that if you want to succeed in life, you can’t be afraid to fail.

After graduating, I followed my girlfriend, now my wife, down to Washington D.C. where she got into her own graduate program. I didn’t yet have a job, but I wasn’t too worried about that, and sure enough, within a few months of arriving, I’d landed a job as a Systems Engineer with a consulting company called VisiTech, Ltd. This job was a lot of fun, and let me use the skills I’d just fought so hard to aquire. I got to work with some extremely smart people, helping to design a big budget simulation for the U.S. Navy intended to help them offset a huge portion of the costs of conducting live fire exercises with simulations of missile attacks and responses. I can’t get into any more detail than that since the project was classified, but it was super interesting, and I learned huge amount about how to model 3d physical environments.

Once my girlfriend (now wife) graduated, we decided to head to New York. She landed an awesome job there as an epidemiologist for the largest municipal public health department in the county, and I decided to try my hand at entrepreneurship, inspired still by that colloquium series. So, I founded Varna Energy Solutions with a good friend of mine from college, whose mission was to leverage the latest technologies to help homeowners reduce their energy consumption. Our original focus was on ground source heat pumps, and after a few months we were accredited installers, working on our first install. 

However, it turns out that 2007-2008 would not be a great time to start a business, especially one focused on the residential building sector, so after the financial collapse, we lost a lot of momentum. My partner decided to go on to something else, but I was determined to see things through a bit longer. I actually managed to start growing the business a bit… enough so that I hired my first full-time employee (another Cornell engineer) to help. But, eventually that growth slowed and I realized that the hours I was spending were simply not worth the meager pay I was allocating myself. So, I decided to throw in the towel.

This was a really hard time for me. I felt like an utter failure in life, and was quite depressed. But, I made myself remember what those other entrepreneurs had told me… their experiences all included failures just like these, and compared to some of their stories, my own really wasn’t that bad. I hadn’t lost any money, afterall. I wasn’t in debt and my sole employee immediately found another job, and as an added upside, the company that ran one of the energy efficiency programs that I had participated in on behalf of the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) had been really impressed by what I’d been doing, and reached out to recruit me. Well, a month or so later, and I found myself working for Conservation Services Group (CSG), later to be acquired by CLEAResult, the largest consulting company in North America focused on renewables and residential energy efficiency and consumption. If you’ve never heard of CSG or CLEAResult, you’re not alone. They do a lot of work behind the scenes, but if you’ve ever participated in a solar program or a rebat / incentive program for either a utility company or a state / regional government anywhere in North America, there’s a very good chance that program was at least in part designed / operated by CSG or CLEAResult. 

I spent the next eight years of my life working my way through a multitude of different projects, for several different clients. It was great experience, but after a while, the old itch returned, and I wanted to try my hand again at my own project. In the years since I’d shuttered Varna, Machine Learning had really taken off. It seemed like every magazine I picked up and journal article I read was referencing some sort of new algorithm. I’d learned a lot about optimization and modeling in general both in grad school, and at my job with VisiTech. And this all sounded right up my alley. So, I decided to start learning more. I found the wealth of information about the subject to be utterly amazing. Back when I was in college, the only place to learn anything meaningful about a complex subject such as this was a college textbook, or journal articles you could only access via a university library. But now, you could take the entire Stanford University Computer Science 229 course on Machine Learning for free via coursera, taught by the world renowned Andrew Ng. And that wasn’t all. Google Deepmind, who is far and away the biggest leader in the field of AI, put out an entire graduate level course on YouTube taught by none other than David Silver. And the textbook to go with it could be downloaded for free! And you could find code samples all over GitHub. Clearly, this is a very different era, and the timing of all this couldn’t be better for my own goals.

So I gobbled up everything I could, started applying these algorithms to my own set of problems, and quickly, as I think most people who learn about machine learning do, started thinking about how I could use this to manage my stock portfolio, which I’d never really been all that great at doing on my own. Well, my first stop was my good friend Jeff Ting, who’d been successfully trading stocks since college (also a graduate of Cornell). I picked his brain, learned about news sentiment analysis, and built my own custom OpenAI environment for stock trading based both on some of the concepts he’d taught me, and concepts like momentum trading and value investing that I’d learned on my via Investopia https://www.investopedia.com/, yet another awesome web resource. I started to make some big breakthroughs, and realized that if I really wanted to make this work, I’d need to work on it full-time. So, I quit my job, and dove in headfirst. I negotiated a contract with the same firm that Jeff worked at, and entered the terms into my OpenAI environment. A year later, and I was right at the brink of making something workable. In backtesting, my algorithm was making tons of money, but it was streaky. Some months would make massive gains, others massive losses, but it was net profitable, and close to beating the market. But, the problem was working with leveraged funds, which I would need to use to make up for the money lost to commissions, and if it started off on one of its losing streaks, which was unlikely, but still a very real possibility, I’d quickly be wiped out. I had to figure out a way to make this work, or else I’d have to put this on the back burner for a bit.

Enter Alpaca https://alpaca.markets/. Alpaca launched late last year that offers online trading bia the easiest to use API I’ve found to date, which also provides access to historic data including earnings reports and even tick data. In fact, they’re still in their promotional startup period, which means you can get all this history data for free, which as anyone who’s shopped around for tick data will recognize as an exceptional deal. It’s a Silicon Valley startup specifically targeting people like me; namely, those developing their own proprietary algorithms to trade stocks. And the best part is that they’re commission free! They manage to provide this service commission free by receiving payment for the order flow https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp, which doesn’t really matter to me since my trading volume is relatively light and my algorithm never trades more than once per minute, due to the frequency of some of my datastreams. Discovering Alpaca was a total game changer for me, and now suddenly my backtesting was showing real promise. I’m currently finalizing my algorithm and entering live testing, with the expectation of being able to trade with real money by the end of Q3 2019. 

Now that I had my issues with my trading system more or less sorted out, I all of sudden found myself with something I hadn’t had in years; spare time. I decided to do two things:

First, I needed to get myself back in shape. I’ve always prioritized physical fitness, at least since my late twenties when my youthful metabolism started to fade, but I’d been reading a lot about how physical fitness can increase cognitive function, and my mind has always been my greatest resource. So I dove full into Muay Thai. I’ve been into martial arts for most of my adult life… trying all sorts of forms… Jeet Kune Do (Bruce Lee’s creation), Jow Ga Kung Fu, Jujitsu, MMA, Panantukan (Filipino boxing), Kali, and traditional western boxing. But my ultimate favorite has always been Muay Thai. It’s pure striking… one of the best cardio workouts you can find, and it’s all about nuance. It’s simple, but it takes years to get good with it, and unlike the more combat oriented martial arts like Krav Maga, it’s a sport so you can spar with it with little physical risk. And when you finally do get good, sparring becomes a complete zen experience… almost like being in a martial arts movie. There’s a flow to it and a kind of feeling of zen that makes me almost giddy. I can’t remember ever having as much fun doing anything else in my life. Things like video games just seem so boring once you obtain a certain level of skill with a martial art and can really flow with it.

The second thing I decided to do was create a YouTube series. Even though I’d succeeded with making an algorithm that can trade stocks, I could hardly share that code. If that code got in the wrong hands (especially my weights file), it could easily be used by a well-funded nefarious trader to identify my moves and milk me dry. But I do want to share some of the biggest lessons I learned in writing it to put a hand back so to speak. I’d received so much from this Open Source movement that not doing that just felt wrong somehow. So, I decided I would create a series that uses several of the same principles I used in my algorithm to solve another problem; namely, predicting the track of hurricanes. I figured this would be a win / win. I could help fill in some of the gaps I found in the other online courses I’d audited while also helping to save lives by advancing the science of forecasting these storms, even if it is just by a small amount.

And that’s my story. I hope you enjoy my YouTube channel.
